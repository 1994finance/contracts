# About 1994.Finance

## A Non-Inflationary Ecosystem

Step into the nostalgic vibes of the 90s with 1994, the retro token with a modern twist. Designed for old-school staking and farming degens, 1994.finance brings a fresh perspective to DeFi.
Here lies a unique, non-inflationary staking and farming model. Here's what makes us stand out:

- Capped Supply: The total supply is limited to 1994 tokens — no more, no less. This scarcity ensures long-term value and prevents dilution.
- Earn Through Volume: Rewards are fueled by the trading volume of the 1994/BNB pair on PancakeSwap. There’s no token inflation—just sustainable growth.
- Fair Taxation: While buying 1994 tokens is tax-free, a modest 2% sell tax directly funds the rewards pools. These pools are amplified by profit-generating strategies, creating a virtuous cycle of growth.

## Unruggable and Fair

Your trust is our foundation:

- Immutable Liquidity: Liquidity for the 1994/BNB pair is locked forever and cannot be removed, as stated in the contracts: a rug-pull is impossible.
- Fair Launch: The initial pool is set at a friendly entry price of $0.25 per 1994 token. Early adopters can get in at ground level.
- Fair Taxation: While buying 1994 tokens is tax-free, a modest 2% sell tax directly funds the rewards pools. These pools are amplified by profit-generating strategies, creating a virtuous cycle of growth.
- Paid dev: Don't worry, I'm paid too. I earn a small 2% fee on the claimed rewards from the pools, and 1% of the selling volume.

## Maximize Your Gains

Whether you're staking, farming, or holding, 1994.finance offers multiple ways to grow your portfolio:
